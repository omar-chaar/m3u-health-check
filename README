# M3uchecker

A tool for checking the health of IPTV channels in M3U playlist. This script checks which channels are alive, unstable, or dead, and produce a filtered playlist of working channels.

## Features

- Check the health of IPTV channels in M3U playlists
- Supports both file paths and URLs for M3U playlists
- Parallel processing for faster checks
- Retry mechanism for unstable channels
- Configurable retry delay and maximum workers
- Log results and diagnosis for each channel
- Produces a new playlist with the channels that are alive, unstable and dead


## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pip

Get Python dependencies:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use

Run health check script:

```cmd
python m3u_health_check.py
```

If you didn't config the config.py file (check [Configuration](#configuration)), the script will prompt you for the following information:

- M3u playlist file path or url
- Delay between retries (seconds)
- Number of parallel checks

After completion, a file called `alive_channels.m3u` will be made with all working channels.

## Configuration

You can edit the 'config.py' file to set the options before runtime:

```Python
# You can set either a file path or a URL, leave one of them empty
URL = "http://example.com/playlist.m3u"
FILE_PATH = "channels_to_check.m3u"
# If you set them as None, the script will prompt you
Retry_delay_in_seconds = 0.3
Max_workers = 50
# If there is authentication, set the username and password
USERNAME = "user"
PASSWORD = "pass"
```

## Logging and Diagnostics

- Logs are written on m3u_checker.log
- Diagnosis for each channel is saved in 'Diagnostics/' Directory
